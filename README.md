# An Exploration of Image Classification and Machine Learning Training Pipelines through Species Identification
This repository represents the culmination of my education in UCSD's Machine Learning Engineering Bootcamp.
It covers three main topics:
* Data
* Modeling and Algoithms
* Engineering and Deployment

## Data


### Finding the right dataset

## Modeling and Algorithms

## Engineering and Deployment

### Model Training Pipeline

### Model Serving
I explored several different methods for model and prediction deployment.
* Client-side
